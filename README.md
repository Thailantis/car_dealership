# Using the PDF of business rules for the car dealership, you will need to come up with an ERD.
Once you have come to a conclusion, you will then create a new database using the ERD.

The files needed to be turned in are:
The ERD PDF
SQL code that would be used to create the new database and insert data.

Once the database has been created, each person should create their own database inside of DBeaver. Also, once the database and the tables are created, each person should have AT LEAST 2 pieces/records of data inside of the tables. (You can add more if you want)

At least 2 of the inserts should come from a stored function. (You can always add more if you want)

Once the code is completed, commit both the PDF of the ERD diagram and the SQL code to github and submit the github link to the assignment.

USE ERD to Create SQL Database 

Car Dealership
Create an ERD for a car dealership. The dealership sells both new and used cars, and it operates a service facility. Base your design on the following business rules:

A salesperson may sell many cars, but each car is sold by only one salesperson.
A customer may buy many cars, but each car is purchased by only one customer.
A salesperson writes a single invoice for each car he or she sells.
A customer gets an invoice for each car he or she buys.
A customer may come in just to have his or her car serviced; that is, a customer need not buy a car to be classified as a customer.
When a customer takes one or more cars in for repair or service, one service ticket is written for each car.
The car dealership maintains a service history for each of the cars serviced. The service  records are referenced by the carâ€™s serial number.
A car brought in for service can be worked on by many mechanics, and each mechanic may work on many cars.

After the tables have been created, use SQL to add data to the database

Each person will need to create their own SQL da
